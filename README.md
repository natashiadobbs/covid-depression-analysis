# COVID-19 and Depression Analysis

This project explores the relationship between depression and the COVID-19 pandemic using data collected from global research studies. It was developed as part of my Data Analytics coursework in the Health Informatics program at Mercer University.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this analysis is to understand how the pandemic affected mental health across different populations by using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques in R. The project includes:

- Summary statistics of depression prevalence across studies  
- A violin plot comparing depression by assessment tool  
- A scatter plot showing sample size vs. mean age  
- Demographic comparisons by gender and profession  

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **R & R Markdown**  
- **ggplot2** for data visualization  
- **Excel** for initial data review  
- **COVID-Depression Case Dataset** (course provided)

## 🔍 Key Findings

- Depression was more prevalent in urban areas and among healthcare workers  
- Depression scores varied depending on which screening tool was used (PHQ-9, DASS-21, WHO-5, SDS)  
- Larger studies provided more representative age distributions  
- Females reported higher mild depression symptoms; males had slightly higher moderate symptoms
